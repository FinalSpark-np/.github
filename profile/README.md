## The FinalSpark Neuroplatform

This collection of repositories is meant to host all the open-source code related to our **NeuroPlatform** (NP).

Partner universities and research institutions using the NeuroPlatform are welcome to add their contributions here.

We encourage collaboration and sharing of knowledge to accelerate the development of this technology.

The human brain is a powerhouse, boasting 86 billion neurons and using only 20 watts of power for efficient computing. Replicating this kind of efficiency with silicon would require 10 megawatts of power, according to Stanford University's Kwabena Boahen.

**We’re creating the solution with biological neural networks.** We’re growing neurons in cell cultures and making great progress in their use as computing power. Creating large networks is challenging and yet, our laboratory is actively working towards replicating nature's success.

The possibilities are very exciting.
