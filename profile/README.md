The human brain is a powerhouse, boasting 86 billion neurons and using only 20 watts of power for efficient computing. Replicating this kind of efficiency with silicon would require a whopping 10 megawatts of power, according to Stanford University's Kwabena Boahen.

**We’re creating the solution with biological neural networks.** We’re growing neurons in cell cultures and making great progress in their use as computing power. Creating large networks is challenging and yet, our bio lab is actively working towards replicating and surpassing nature's success with limitless potential for enhancing life on earth. The possibilities are very exciting.
